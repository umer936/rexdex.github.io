I've updated the recompiler project a little bit. 

I decided to go toward tracing compiler model with JIT compilation. Also, I plan to add support for more than one platform, this time it will be good old DOS. Up till now everything was kind of hardcoded for Xbox360 but I think it's better to open up to more posibilities ithe long run. The project was also moved to new repository on GitHub.

The great help for anybody doing anything with the Intel assembly is their free encoder/decoder library:
[Intel® X86 Encoder Decoder Software Library](https://software.intel.com/en-us/articles/xed-x86-encoder-decoder-software-library)

It literaly saves a month or more that would have to be spent otherwise + is much more tested :)

Cheers,
Dex
